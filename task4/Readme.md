# About
__Final block includes fourth JS-tasks__

## Discribe ##
In our fourth unit we will work with js-async and apply knowledge for create  and fix various functions.
1.  In this task we added to main-function missing code for calling function ‘logHi’ after 2 second. List of technologies:
- Promise;
- resolve, reject;
- setTimeout;
- callback functions

2.  In second task we rebuild or rewrote code for showing calling result ‘droids’ from ‘makeDroids’ step by step in ‘for of’ cycle. We used:
- let, var keyfords;
- closure;
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

3. In this block we created interesting function which can show randomly result in Chrome's console. The Current result depends on randomly call-back function which generate timeout-data. At the next step we use the timeout-data in our current function and in depend calculate results we can see console.log or console.error. We worked with:
- setTimeout;
- Promise
- callback functions  etc.

4. In finally unit we added  into ‘demoGithubUser’ function ‘while cycle’ instead recursion, rebuild request async to ‘async/await’  and refactored code.  As result we have function which to user some info about git-hub users and if this user exist return some info about him. We work with:
- callback;
- cycle;
- cloasync/await;
- try/catch
- error etc.
