__Now this block includes third JS-tasks__

## Discribe ##
In this block we worked with timers, created some events and time-loops, for example:
1.  We realized update-status function.This function will rewrite new item in table-cell after function-helper will have checked ‘Pending’ array value. We used:
- setTimeOut;
- clearTimeout;
- callback functions.

2. we added form with inputs and created function, which could transmit input value from first input to second after 1 sec. Its work with:
- callback functions;
- closures;
-setTimeout.
